  Resourceful and proactive are two words that describe me best. I have extensive experience in customer service, sales and marketing. Providing excellent and personal client support in person and over the phone. Previously worked with multiple
  business to foster and expand client relations and train new employees on policies. Familiar with handling web request, follow up and managing various forms of projects and functions. Sensitive attention to detail, impeccable organizational skills,
  ability to self manage and complete projects in a timely manner while managing multiple tasks. Looking to further expand my skills, experience and knowledge of the Graphic Design industry at a reputable organization with potential for growth.
